THE SAMLL MOUND THERE WAS<br> KNOWN AS THE SACRED HILL, AND ON ITS SUMMIT THERE WAS A GREAT ROCK. DURING<br> THE YUAN DYNASTY THE THREE CHARACTERS &quot;SUNG WONG TOI&quot; WERE ENGRAVED<br> HORIZONTALLY UPON THE WESTERN FACE OF THIS ROCK; LATER A FURTHER SEVEN<br> CHARACTERS WERE ADDED VERTICALLY, RECORDING THAT REPAIRS HAD BEEN CARRIED<br> OUT IN 1807 A. D., IN THE TING MAU YEAR OF THE CHING EMPEROR KA HING.</p><p>IN 1915 PROFESSOR LAI CHAI-HEI (BETTER KNOWN AS LAI CHI-HSI) OF THE<br> UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG APPEALED TO THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT TO RESERVE<br> FOREVER THIS AREA AND THIS TERRACE. MR. LI SUI-KAM, A LEADING HONG KONG CITIZEN,<br> LENT HIS SUPPORT AND PAID FOR THE ERACTION OF AN ENCIRCLING STONE BALUSTRADE.<br> WHEN THE JAPANESE ARMED FORCES OCCUPIED HONG KONG IN 1941-5 AND ENLARGED<br> THE AIRPORT, THEY BLASTED THE GREAT ROCK WHICH BROKE INTO THREE: ONE PART<br> RETAINED THE ORIGINAL INSCRIPTION INTACT.</p><p>AFTER THE LIBERATION IN 1945, THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT HELD TO ITS<br> FORMER DESIRE TO PRESERVE THIS ANCIENT MONUMENT. A PARK WAS CREATED TO<br> THE SOUTH-WEST OF THE AIRFIELD, ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET FROM THE SITE OF<br> THE ORIGINAL SUNG WONG TOI, AND THE INCRIBED ROCK WAS DRESSED AND PLACED<br> WITHIN THAT PARK. THIS, TOO, FULFILLED A PUBLIC WISH.</p><p>RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT, DURING THE MING AND CHING DYANSTIES, THIS<br> AREA WAS A PART OF THE SAN ON DISTRICT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE<br> PREFECTURE OF KWONG CHOW. DURING THE SUNG DYNASTY, THIS AREA WAS PART OF THE<br> TUNG KWUN DISTRICT OF THE SAME PREFECTURE, AND WAS KNOWN AS KWUN FOO CHEUNG.</p><p>WHEN THE SUNG EMPEROR TUEN CHUNG ASCENDED TO THE THRONE IN FOO CHOW,<br> THE ARMIES OF THE MONGLS PRESSED UPON HIM AND HE FLED BY SEA TO CHEUN CHOW,<br> THENCE TO CHIU CHOW AND KAP TSZ MUN IN WAI CHOW. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE<br> SECOND YEAR OF HIS REGIN (1277), THE EMPEROR ENTERED KWONG CHOW TERRITORY.<br> THENCE, IN THE SECOND MOON, HE SAILED TO MUI WAI, IN THE FOURTH MOON, HE<br> LANDED HERE AT KWUN FOO CHEUNG AND SET UP HIS TEMPORARY PALACE NEAR THE<br> PLACE NOW KNOWN AS THE SUNG WONG TOI. SOME SAY THAT THE EMPEROR TUEN<br> CHUNG FROM TIME TO TIME TOOK HIS REST IN A SPACE BENEATH THE GREAT ROCK,<br> AND THIS LEGEND IS GIVEN AS THE REASON FOR THE NAME &quot;SUNG WONG TOI&quot;</p><p>IN THE SIXTH MOON OF THE SAME YEAR, THE EMPEROR MOVED TO KWU TAP,<br> AND IN THE NINTH MOON, TO TSIN WAN, WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS TSUEN WAN. IN<br> THE ELEVENTH MOON, THE MONGOL ARMIES ATTACKED, AND THE EMPEROR SAILED AWAY<br> TO SAU SHAN, THUS HAVING CAMPED IN KOWLOON FOR ABOUT TEN MONTHS.</p><p>THROUGHOUT THE SUNG DYNASTY, FOREIGN INVASIONS FREQUENTLY OCCURRED.<br> IN ALMOST EVERY YEAR THERE WAS WAR AGAINST NOT ONLY THE TANGUT, BUT ALSO,<br> IN TURN, THE INVADING KHITAN, NUCHEN AND MONGOLS. AT THE CLOSE OF THE<br> SUNG DYNASTY, THE EMPEROR HIMSELF HAD TO FLEE AND SEEK REFUGE BY THE<br> SHORES OF THE SEA, FROM WHERE HE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE THE RESTORATION<br> OF HIS EMPIRE. BUT THIS MOUND AND THIS SPOT COMMEMORATE ONE OF THE<br> LAST PORTIONS OF SUNG TERRITORY ON WHICH THE EMPEROR STOOD.</p><p>THE CHRACTER &quot;WONG&quot; ON THE GREAT ROCK SHOULD BE THAT FOR &quot;EMPEROR&quot;<br> AND NOT THE CHARACTER FOR &quot;KING&quot;. THE MISTAKE WAS FIRST MADE IN THE YUAN<br> (MONGOL) OFFICIAL HISTORY OF THE SUNG DYNASTY, WHERE IT WAS RECOREDED<br> THAT THERE WERE TWO KINGS. NOW THIS PARK IS CALLED THE &quot;GRADEN OF THE<br> SUNG EMPEROR&#39;S TERRACE&quot; AND THE ROAD BEFORE IT IS NAMED THE &quot;SUNG EMPEROR&#39;S<br> TERRACE ROAD&quot;. THIS USE OF THE TITLE &quot;EMPEROR&quot; IS CORRECT.</p><p>WHEN THE EMPEROR TUEN CHUNG FLED TO THE SOUTH, MANY OF HIS CLANSMEN<br> FOLLOWED HIM. LATER THEY SCATTERED AND SETTLED IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS.<br> THE ANCESTRAL RECORDS OF THE CHIU CLAN CONFIRM THIS.</p><p>IT IS SAID THAT, TO THE SOUTH-WEST OF THE SUNG WONG TOI, THERE WAS<br> ONCE A VILLAGE CALLED &quot;THE TWO KINGS&#39; PALACE&quot;, WHICH WAS SO NAMED BECAUSE<br> THE EMPEROR TUEN CHUNG AND HIS BROTHER, WAI WONG PING WHO SUCCEEDED<br> HIM, VISITED THAT VILLAGE TOGETHER. TO THE NORTH THERE WAS THE TOMB OF<br> THE LADY KAM; IT IS RECORDED THAT THE PRINCESS OF CHUN, DAUGHTER OF THE<br> QUEEN MOTHER YEUNG, WAS DROWNED NEARBY AND A GOLDEN IMAGE OF HER WAS<br> BURIED IN THAT TOMB. TO THE NORTH-WEST IS THE TEMPLE OF HAU-WONG; A<br> TABLET ERECTED BY MR. CHAN PAK-TO OF TUNG KWUN DISTRICT PUTS FORWARD THE<br> THEROY THAT YEUNG LEUNG-CHIT, BROTHER OF THE QUEEN MOTHER, WAS BURIED AT<br> AT THIS SPOT AND THAT THE LOCAL PEOPLE BUILT THE TEMPLE IN MEMORY OF HIS<br> LOYALTY. THERE IS ALSO A STONE CALLED THE &quot; ARMCHAIR STONE&quot; NEAR YAU SIN<br> NGAM ON THE WHITE CRANE MOUNTAIN; A STORY TELLS HOW THE EMPEROR OCCASIONALLY<br> ESTABLISHED HIS COURT THERE. USING THE STONE AS THIS TEMPORARY<br> THRONE, ALL THESE LEGENDS CONNECTED WITH THE HISTORY OF THE SUNG WONG<br> TOI, ARE RECORDED HERE TO FACILITATE FUTURE RESEARCH.</p><p>IN 1957, DURING THE WINTER OF THE TING YAU YEAR, MR. KAN YAU-MAN OF<br> SAN WUI COMPOSED THE ORIGINAL CHINESE TEXT OF THIS RECORD, WHICH WAS<br> INSCRIBED BY MR. CHIU CHIU OF TOI SHAN FOR ENGRAVING. THE CHIU CLANMEN&#39;S<br> ASSOCIATION OF HONG KONG, BESIDES PUBLISHING A SECIAL BOOK IN COMMEMORATION<br> OF THIS HISTORIC SPOT, ASSISTED IN SELECTING THE STONE AND SUPERVISING<br> THE PREPARATION OF THESE MEMORIAL TABLETS.</p><p>ERECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF HONG KONG, 1959.</p>',17),M={render:function(E,T){const O=(0,N.up)("OutboundLink");return(0,N.wg)(),(0,N.iD)(N.HY,null,[A,H,(0,N._)("blockquote",null,[(0,N._)("ul",null,[(0,N._)("li",null,[R,(0,N._)("a",I,[S,(0,N.Wm)(O)]),D,(0,N._)("a",r,[C,(0,N.Wm)(O)]),U]),G])]),L],64)}}}}]);
